## FAQ

### Which transit systems are supported?
Stockholm T-Minus works with all SL (Storstockholms Lokaltrafik) services including:
- Tunnelbana (metro)
- Pendeltåg (commuter rail)
- Buses
- Trams
- Light rail (Tvärbanan, Roslagsbanan, etc.)
- Ferries

### Does it work outside Stockholm?
No. The app only covers the SL network in the Stockholm region. It does not include other Swedish transit systems.

### Why do some stops not appear in search?
The app only shows stops that have actual departures. If a stop doesn't appear, it may be temporarily closed or not have any scheduled services in the next 24 hours.

### How accurate are the departure times?
Departure times come directly from SL's real-time API. The accuracy depends on SL's data — the app displays exactly what SL reports.

### Why do I only see a few upcoming departures per line?
The app can only display up to 3 upcoming departures per line and direction. This is a limitation of the data SL provides, not the app itself.

### Does the app work offline?
No. Stockholm T-Minus requires an internet connection to fetch real-time departure data. There is no offline mode.

### Why does the widget sometimes show old data?
Android limits how often widgets can update to preserve battery life. Tap the refresh button to make sure you're getting the latest data.

### Can I plan a trip with this app?
No. Stockholm T-Minus shows departures from specific stops only. For trip planning (A to B routing), use the official SL app or website.

### Is my location data shared?
No. Location data is only used to find nearby stops and is never stored, transmitted to servers, or shared with anyone. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy) for details.

### Is this an official SL app?
No. Stockholm T-Minus is an independent app and is not affiliated with SL or Region Stockholm. Departure data is provided via the public [Trafiklab](https://www.trafiklab.se/) APIs.
